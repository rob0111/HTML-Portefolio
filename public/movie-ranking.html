<h1>The Best Movies According to Robby</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies series of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Hunger Games</h3>
<p>This is my favourite Dystopian Movie series. I love how the atmosphere is fleshed out, and how the idea of staging sincerity is filmed.</p>
<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>Really deep and great series that grew up with so many of us.</p>
<h3>Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>Super beautiful films set in New Zealand: the actors and screenwriters manage to retranscript the epic.</p>
